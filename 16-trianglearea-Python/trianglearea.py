# trianglearea(s1, s2, s3)[5pts]
# Write the function trianglearea(s1, s2, s3) that takes 3 floats/ints and returns the area of the
# triangle that has those lengths of its side. If no such triangle exists, return 0. Hint: you
# will probably wish to use Heron's Formula.

def trianglearea(s1, s2, s3):
    a = (s1+s2+s3)/2
    area = math.sqrt(a*(a-s1)*(a-s2)*(a-s3))
    return area
